opener: Meet our Team
intro: >-
  We're very thankful and proud of all our team members, who spend their free
  time to a good cause, voluntarily. The people who work with us are very
  various people, some have just started their career in cybersecurity and
  others have worked in cybersecurity for a very long time. Due to privacy
  reasons, which we can only encourage, not every member has a profile picture
  or is mentioned in a team.

  - title: Research & Development
    description: >-
      DIVD has two teams highly skilled security researchers who seek and report
      vulnerabilities as a voluntary service next to their jobs. DIVD sees to it
      they follow our Code of Conduct while we provide them a firewall for
      journalists, lawyers and recruiters. Meanwhile, their research also serves
      as an empirical base to discover trends in security, stimulate security
      awareness and develop new methodologies in vulnerability research and
      disclosure. So, although you will probably never meet our researchers, you
      may hope they are checking your systems right now, before the bad guys do…
